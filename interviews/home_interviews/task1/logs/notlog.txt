write python script that gets
argument (array of string to search, folder name)

  ### The program should
    * Scan the <folder name> (the folder should contain log files)
    * Look for each string from the array on eacg file
    * Return result report with below table:

| File Name | String | Count (number of instances) |
|-----------|--------|-----------------------------|
| A.log     | Error  | 2                           |
| A.log     | Fatal  | 3                           |
| B.log     | Error  | 1                           |

  * Prefer html report while the file name is link to the file
  * The table should be sorted by Count column
